Ancestry pipeline
=================
Overall description: Run PCA on a VCF, phase data, convert phased data to RFMix format, run local ancestry with RFMix, collapse RFMix output into bed files, alter bed files, plot karyograms, estimate global ancestry proportions, run TRACTS, generate PCAMask input, run PCA on PCAMask output (ASPCA).

This repo gives information about how to run through phasing, local ancestry inference, generate collapsed bed files, plot karyograms, estimate global ancestry proportion from local ancestry proportions, generate and run ASPCA, and run TRACTS to model migration events, proportions, and timings.
